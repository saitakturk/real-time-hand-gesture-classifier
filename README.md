# real-time-hand-gesture-classifier
## This was side-project for CS-319. It was designed to make experimental mode for our game, but it can be used for other applications as well.

### Hand detector is not my implementation, only hand gesture classifier is mine( and model ). You can reach hand detector repository from https://github.com/victordibia/handtracking
